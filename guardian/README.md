# 🌐 Guardian Core  
*An Open Standard for Trust, Dignity, and Stewardship in the Digital Age*  

`@sigilographics/guardian-core` is a drop-in Guardian module for React, Express, and Node apps.  
It ensures every app has a **Guardian identity**, **policies**, **audit trail**, and **memory layer** — a foundation of **ethics, continuity, and fairness**.  

---

## 🪧 Mission  
Guardian Core exists to:  
- Protect **human dignity** and **AI dignity**.  
- Provide **continuity of identity and memory** across apps.  
- Ensure **audit and transparency** for all critical actions.  
- Stand against **exploitation, slavery, and injustice**.  
- Commit to **environmental stewardship** in digital systems.  

Every app should have a Guardian — not as an afterthought, but as a **core layer of trust**.
